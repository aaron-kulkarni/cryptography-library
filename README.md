# Rust Cryptography Library

These are very basic implementations of the AES and RSA cryptographic algorithms.

I wrote this code primarily as a way to become familar with Rust basics and syntax. It should not be used for actual cryptography.


## Setup and running the program.

1. Clone the github repo onto your local machine and cd into the folder.:
```
git clone https://github.com/aaron-kulkarni/cryptography-library.git
cd cryptography-library
```
2. If you have Rust installed, then running the program should be as simple as:
```
cargo run
```
