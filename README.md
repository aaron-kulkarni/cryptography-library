# RUST CRYPTOGRAPHY LIBRARY

These are very basic implementations of various cryptographic algorithms. So far, only AES is implemented.

I wrote this code primarily as a way to become familar with Rust basics and syntax. It should not be used for actualy cryptography.


## Setup and running the program.

1. Clone the github repo onto your local machine and cd into the folder.:
```
git clone https://github.com/aaron-kulkarni/cryptography-library.git
cd cryptography-library
```
2. If you have Rust installed, then running the program should be as simple as:
```
cargo run
```
3. If you don't have Rust installed, you can run the program binary itself.


### Coming soon:
* RSA
* SHA-256
